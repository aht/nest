<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
	NEST stands for 
	<em>Notation for Expressing Structured Text</em>. It is a markup
	language with the same semantics as XML but is designed to be more readable
	and easier to write by hand.
	</p>


<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>
	NEST can express familiar XML concepts such as elements, tags and attributes.
	A structural element is introduced by a backslash followed by the tag name;
	the content of the element follows in enclosing angle brackets, like this:
	</p>
<pre> 
	\html &lt;
		Your page goes here.
	&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	There are two shortcuts to make NEST more readable and less tangled.
	</p>

<p>
	Tag without following brackets takes the next word or element in the same
	line to be its content, e.g.
	</p>
<pre> 
	This \strong word has strength, where as \em this is emphasized. You can
	also chain the tags as in \em \strong &lt;this phrase&gt;.
</pre>

<p>
	Tag followed by a colon takes the rest of the line to be its content, e.g.
	</p>
<pre> 
	\title: NEST documentation
	\author: Yours truly
</pre>

<p>
	If there is nothing but white spaces after the colon, the tag takes an
	indented block to be the content, e.g.
	</p>
<pre> 
	\blockquote:
		Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they
		take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something
		different. â€” T.S. Eliot, The Sacred Wood
</pre>

<p>
	Attributes are placed between the tag and the content in enclosing square
	brackets, e.g.
	</p>
<pre> 
	\div [id="main" class="long article"] &lt; ... &gt;
</pre>

<p>
	NEST's directives can be escaped with the backslash, for example 
	<code>\\tag</code>is a
	literal 
	<code>\tag</code>(in contrast, a 
	<code>&lt;tag&gt;</code>in XML is 
	<code>&amp;lt;tag&amp;gt;).</code>Brackets that are not part of any tag are also treated as literals.
	</p>

<p>
	NEST allows comments in the form of
	<code>\==+ &lt; ... </code>&gt; or
	<code>\--+ &lt; ... </code>&gt;.
	Empty comments should be used decoratively to make NEST source code more readable, e.g.
	</p>

<h2>Transformation</h2>
<p>
	Since NEST is a markup language, you can interpret the structured text
	however you want.
	</p>

<h3>NEST to XML</h3>
<p>
	XML is understood everywhere else, and NEST was originally invented to make
	writing XML easier anyway. The program 
	<code>n2x</code> performs this
	transformation.  It is implemented using PLY (Python lex/yacc).
	</p>

<h3>XML to NEST</h3>
<p>
	The converse transformation from XML to NEST is quite easy, as no parser is
	necessary.  A simple 
	<code>sed</code>script, provided as x2n, will do.
	</p>
<p>
	Using 
	<code>sed</code>means that we cannot convert tag declarations spreading over
	many lines, but you can substitute Perl/Python/lex.
	</p>


<h2>Q&amp;A</h2>
<div class="q">What can be expressed in SGML but not in NEST?</div>
<div class="a">
	Overlapping tags, e.g. 
	<pre> 
		&lt;foo&gt; spam &lt;bar&gt; inter-mingled with &lt;/foo&gt; ham &lt;/bar&gt;
	</pre>I certainly hope that this "feature" will not be missed!
	</div>

<div class="q">What's the relation between NEST and XML?</div>
<div class="a">
	NEST is a markup language with the same semantics as XML. Practically, this
	means that NEST is an alternative notation for XML.
	</div>

<div class="q">What's the relation between NEST and HAML?</div>
<div class="a">
	NEST is a markup language with the same semantics as XML, whereas HAML is a
	both a pre-processor for XHTML and a templating engine.  A practical
	difference is that it is awkward to write text where white space needs to be
	preserved in HAML.
	</div>

<div class="q">What's the relation between NEST and YAML?</div>
<div class="a">
	NEST is a textual markup language, whereas YAML is a data serialization
	format.
	</div>
